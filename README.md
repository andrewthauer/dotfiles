## Features

- **extremely fast startup!** with lazy loading for expensive operations.
- **limited dependencies** make it very portable.
- **[`stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) powered:** symlink dotfiles and
  thus keep them always up-to-date.
- **topical organization** to organize dotfiles by topic for easy reuse across
  different machines.
- [XDG](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
  compliance when possible to keep `$HOME` clean
  - See
    [Arch Linux wiki for XDG Base Directory Support](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory)
- **install scripts** for brand new systems and specific topic areas.
- **posix compliant** so it works with most shells (`bash`, `zsh`).
- **optimized for zsh** with auto-completion & syntax highlighting.
- **pure** pretty, fast, minimal command prompt.
- **useful aliases & utilities** for maximum productivity.
- **vim & nvim** work interchangeably.
- **[homebrew](https://brew.sh) compatible** packages with smart fallbacks.

## Pre-requisites

The following packages are required:

- `git`
- `make`
- `stow`

## Installation

```shell
git clone git@github.com:andrewthauer/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
make
# now restart your shell ...
```

To install on a brand new system:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewthauer/dotfiles/master/install.sh)"
```

- [macOS](@macos/README.md)
- [Linux](@linux/README.md)
- [Windows](@windows/README.md)

## Core Packages

- [bash](bash/README.md)
- [git](git/README.md)
- [homebrew](homebrew/README.md)
- [ssh](ssh/README.md)
- [zsh](zsh/README.md)

## Configuration

Most common configuration is handled by symlinking files to the `$HOME`
directory. This is handled by `stow`.

- OS specific packages are prefixed with `@`.
- Additional modules are stored in `modules` and can be added & removed.
- Local system configs & secrets should be added to the `@local` directory and
  never committed.

```
stow -t ~ [pkg-name]
```

### Local Customization

The `@local` directory (git ignored) can be used to customize the dotfiles for a
particular environment. It is also a good place to store an secret information
you don't want to commit to source control.

_NOTE: Make sure you create a `@local/.stow-local-ignore` file to avoid
symlinking unwanted paths_

## Testing

A fresh machine setup can be tested by running `docker-compose` up in the
[test](./test) directory. This will run the install script that is intended to
bootstrap a new system.

### Profiling

It is very important to make sure the shell startup is fast. To help ensure this
there is built-in support for profiling the startup time.

- The `time-zsh` command can be used to profile `zsh` startup time
  - `time-zsh -r` loads `zsh` multiple times to get an average
  - `time-zsh -p` runs `zsh` with the `zprof` module for an execution summary.
    This helps determine areas that are having the largest affect on the startup
    time.
- The `time-bash` command will display the execution time for loading a `bash`
  shell
