## Features

- **extremely fast startup!** with lazy loading for expensive operations.
- **limited dependencies** make it very portable.
- **[`stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) powered:** symlink dotfiles and
  thus keep them always up-to-date.
- **topical organized** packages by topic for easy reuse across different
  machines.
- **[xdg compliance](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)**
  when possible to keep `$HOME` clean <sup id="a1"> [1](#f1)</sup>.
- **install scripts** for brand new systems and specific topic areas.
- **posix compliant** so it works with most shells (`bash`, `zsh`).
- **optimized for zsh** with auto-completion & syntax highlighting.
- **useful aliases & utilities** for maximum productivity.
- **vim & nvim** work interchangeably.
- **[homebrew](https://brew.sh) compatible** packages with smart fallbacks.

## Pre-requisites

- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/)
- [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [`stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/stow.html)

## Installation

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewthauer/dotfiles/main/install.sh)"
```

Or ...

1. Clone the repo
   `git clone git@github.com:andrewthauer/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
2. Change directories `~/.dotfiles`
3. Run `make` to run core setup
4. Install desired package via `stow <directory>`
5. Restart your shell ...

## Documentation

Each directory contains a `README.md` file that describes it's purpose. Most
directories are topic packages that can be installed by running
`stow <directory>`. This will create symlinks to the appropriate locations
within the `$HOME` directory.

## Directories

- `bin` - General purpose scripts which are added to the path.
- `lib` - Core utilities used throughout. Must be sourced up front.
- `modules` - Various package modules.
- `scripts` - Scripts used for setup and maintenance.

_NOTE: Directories starting with an `__double-underscore` will be ignored by
stow._

## Local Customization

The `local` directory (git ignored) can be used to customize the dotfiles for a
particular environment. It is also a good place to store an secret information
you don't want to commit to source control.

## Commands

- `make lint` - runs `shellcheck` & `shfmt` on all shell scripts.
- `make chklink` - reports links that are not installed or potentially broken.

### Profiling

It is very important to make sure the shell startup is fast. To help ensure this
there is built-in support for profiling the startup time.

- The `time-zsh` command can be used to profile `zsh` startup time.
- The `time-bash` command will display the execution time for loading a `bash`
  shell
