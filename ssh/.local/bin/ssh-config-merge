#   This function can be used to merge various ssh configurations files
#   together into `~.ssh/config` (since ssh does not have an include file
#   feature). This can be useful to separate personal and work ssh
#   configurations.
#
# setup:
#   Add `config-[id]` files to `~/.ssh`
#     (e.g. config-base, config-personal, etc.)
#
# usage: ssh-config-merge
#   -> # ~/.ssh/config
#

set -e

# The target file
target="${target:-$HOME/.ssh/config}"

# Truncate the file
if [[ -e "$HOME/.ssh/config" ]]; then
  echo "Do you want to replace the existing '$target' file [y/N]?"
  read reply
  if [[ $reply =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    cat /dev/null > $target
