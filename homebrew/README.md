# Homebrew & Linuxbrew

This package initializes [homebrew](https://brew.sh) and also adds some useful
aliases to the shell.

## Setup

Run `brew bundle` to install all the packages in the `Brewfile`.

You can also create a `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/homebrew/Brewfile.local` file to install
any system specific brews.
