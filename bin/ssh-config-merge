#   This function can be used to merge various ssh configurations files
#   together into `~.ssh/config` (since ssh does not have an include file
#   feature). This can be useful to separate personal and work ssh
#   configurations.
#
# setup:
#   Add `config-[id]` files to `~/.ssh`
#     (e.g. config-base, config-personal, etc.)
#
# usage: ssh-config-merge
#   -> # ~/.ssh/config
#

# The source files

# Truncate the file
