# Summary:
#   Merges ssh config files
#
# Usage:
#   ssh-config-merge
#
# Setup:
#   Add `config-[id]` files to `~/.ssh`
#     (e.g. config-base, config-personal, etc.)
#
# Notes:
#   Prefer the `Include` directive if using ssh >= v7.3p1
#
#   This function can be used to merge various ssh configurations files
#   together into `~.ssh/config` (since ssh does not have an include file
#   feature). This can be useful to separate personal and work ssh
#   configurations.
