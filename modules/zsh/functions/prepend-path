# Two additional quick tips useful for $PATH manipulation in zsh (for anyone passing by):
# (1) to prepend instead of append: path[1,0]=/path/to/dir, and (2) if you're using
# globbing to find the dirs, you don't have to use a for loop and instead just do
# path+=( $PWD/node_modules/**/bin ) (also works with (1) )

# Add directory to PATH if it exits
function prepend-path () {
  dir=$1
  force=$2
  if [ -n $force ] ; then 
    export PATH=$dir:$PATH
  else
    [ -d $dir ] && export PATH=$dir:$PATH
  fi
