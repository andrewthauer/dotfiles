# nvim

Configuration for [neovim](https://neovim.io).

## Overview

This is my personal configuration for neovim so far (always a work in progress).
It is heavily inspired by [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) but customized to
my needs.

## Plugins

See [plugins](.config/nvim/lua/plugins) for a list of plugins that are currently
installed.
